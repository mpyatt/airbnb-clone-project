# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive full-stack web development initiative that simulates the design and development of a robust property rental platform. It mirrors core functionalities of Airbnb, including user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. This project focuses on backend development, database design, API security, and DevOps practices to give learners hands-on experience in building scalable and secure web applications.

### Project Goals

* Build a scalable backend infrastructure using Django
* Design a relational database schema with MySQL
* Implement secure RESTful APIs and GraphQL queries
* Integrate CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments
* Foster collaborative development using GitHub

## Database Design

The system is designed around core entities that reflect the business logic of a rental platform.

### Entities and Key Fields

1. **User**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * name
   * email
   * password\_hash
   * is\_host (Boolean)

2. **Property**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * title
   * description
   * location
   * host\_id (Foreign Key to User)

3. **Booking**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * property\_id (FK to Property)
   * user\_id (FK to User)
   * start\_date
   * end\_date

4. **Review**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * user\_id (FK to User)
   * property\_id (FK to Property)
   * rating
   * comment

5. **Payment**

   * id (Primary Key)
   * booking\_id (FK to Booking)
   * amount
   * payment\_status
   * transaction\_date

### Relationships

* A **User** can be both a guest and a host.
* A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (if `is_host = true`).
* A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
* A **Booking** must be linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
* A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown

1. **User Management**

   * Allows users to sign up, log in, manage profiles, and become hosts.
   * Provides authentication and session handling.

2. **Property Management**

   * Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
   * Properties include metadata like photos, descriptions, and availability.

3. **Booking System**

   * Users can search properties by location and date.
   * Allows users to book properties and receive confirmation.

4. **Review System**

   * Users can review properties after a stay.
   * Includes ratings and comments that affect property visibility.

5. **Payment Integration**

   * Processes transactions for bookings.
   * Manages payment status and transaction history.

6. **Admin Dashboard**

   * Provides role-based access to manage users, properties, and transactions.
   * Includes analytics and system logs.

## API Security

To ensure safe and secure communication and data handling, the following security measures will be implemented:

| Measure                             | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**                  | Verifies the identity of users using JWT or OAuth2. Ensures only verified users access the platform. |
| **Authorization**                   | Grants or denies access based on user roles (guest, host, admin).                                    |
| **Input Validation & Sanitization** | Prevents SQL injection and XSS by validating all user input.                                         |
| **Rate Limiting**                   | Limits the number of API requests to prevent abuse (e.g., DoS attacks).                              |
| **HTTPS Enforcement**               | Ensures all communication is encrypted using TLS/SSL.                                                |
| **CSRF & CORS Protection**          | Prevents cross-site request forgery and enforces secure API access across domains.                   |

### Why Security is Important

* Protects **user data** from unauthorized access.
* Secures **financial transactions** and personal payment information.
* Builds **trust** in the application by mitigating threats.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the testing and deployment of code to speed up development cycles, ensure code quality, and reduce manual errors.

### Tools Used

* **GitHub Actions**: For automating tests, builds, and deployments.
* **Docker**: For creating consistent and reproducible environments across local, staging, and production servers.
* **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container applications (e.g., Django app + MySQL DB).
* **Pre-commit Hooks**: To ensure code quality standards (e.g., linting) before merge.

### Benefits

* Faster and safer code deployments.
* Early detection of bugs via automated testing.
* Reliable integration and delivery process for production readiness.
